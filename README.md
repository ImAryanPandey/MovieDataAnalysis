# Movie Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing movie data, starting from cleaning raw data to performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generating insights. The dataset consists of information about movies, including production budget, box office revenue, genres, and other metadata.

## ðŸš€ Agile Methodology Implementation

We are following the Agile Methodology to ensure an iterative approach with continuous improvements. Our workflow consists of:

- Sprint Planning - Defining tasks for each phase.

- Data Cleaning Phase - Processing the raw dataset.

- EDA Phase - Extracting meaningful insights through visualizations.

- Documentation & GitHub Integration - Maintaining proper records of what has been done.

- Final Review & Enhancements - Improving based on feedback.

## ðŸ“Š Requirements Analysis

- Business Goal: Understand movie performance based on financial metrics and other factors.

- Dataset Source: Kaggle movie dataset (Raw Data used for cleaning).

- Data Cleaning Needs: Handling missing values, fixing data types, and removing inconsistencies.

- Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Kaggle, Jupyter Notebook, GitHub.
